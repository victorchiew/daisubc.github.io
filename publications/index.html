    <p>Supply chain optimization for biomass-based power plants is an important
research area due to greater emphasis on renewable power energy sources.
Biomass supply chain design and operational planning models are often
formulated and studied using deterministic mathematical models. While
these models are beneficial for making decisions, their applicability to
real world problems may be limited because they do not capture all the
complexities in the supply chain, including uncertainties in the
parameters. This paper develops a statistically robust quantile-based
approach for stochastic optimization under uncertainty, which builds
upon scenario analysis. We apply and evaluate the performance of our
approach to address the problem of analyzing competing biomass supply
chains subject to stochastic demand and supply. The proposed approach
was found to outperform alternative methods in terms of computational
efficiency and ability to meet the stochastic problem requirements.

    <p>\textcopyright 2016 IEEE.The minimum variance controller has been extensively used as a benchmark in the performance assessment of both univariate and multivariate control loops when time delay is the fundamental performance limitation. In this paper, the spatial and temporal performance limitations in the cross-directional (CD) control of paper machines are analyzed. The idea of minimum variance benchmarking is extended to the CD process based on these performance limitations. Based on an industrial CD controller, a user-specified benchmark, which is more practical and less aggressive, is also proposed. In addition, several related performance indices are proposed for the CD process based on both the minimum variance benchmark and the user-specified benchmark. Illustrative examples from a paper machine simulator and industrial data sets are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed performance indices.</p>

    <p>\textcopyright 2016 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).We consider the problem of robust alarm design for chemical processes represented by stochastic state-space models (SSMs). Alarm design for such complex processes faces three important challenges: 1) processes exhibit highly non-linear behavior; 2) state variables are not precisely known (modeling error) and often unmeasured (hidden); and 3) process signals are not necessarily Gaussian, stationary or uncorrelated. We propose the design of a delay timer alarm for monitoring unmeasured latent variables. The proposed design reduces the false and missed alarm rates. To deal with non-stationary process behavior in normal and abnormal operations, we propose an average-case delay timer alarm design. The efficacy of the proposed robust alarm design is illustrated on a non-stationary chemical reactor.</p>

    <p>The dynamics of lithium-ion batteries are complex and are often approximated by models consisting of partial differential equations (PDEs) relating the internal ionic concentrations and potentials. The Pseudo two-dimensional model (P2D) is one model that performs sufficiently accurately under various operating conditions and battery chemistries. Despite its widespread use for prediction, this model is too complex for standard estimation and control applications. This article presents an original algorithm for state-of-charge estimation using the P2D model. Partial differential equations are discretized using implicit stable algorithms and reformulated into a nonlinear state-space model. This discrete, high-dimensional model (consisting of tens to hundreds of states) contains implicit, nonlinear algebraic equations. The uncertainty in the model is characterized by additive Gaussian noise. By exploiting the special structure of the pseudo two-dimensional model, a novel particle filter algorithm that sweeps in time and spatial coordinates independently is developed. This algorithm circumvents the degeneracy problems associated with high-dimensional state estimation and avoids the repetitive solution of implicit equations by defining a ???tether??? particle. The approach is illustrated through extensive simulations.</p>

The primer is written for beginners and practitioners interested in learning about the theory and implementation of particle filtering methods. Throughout this primer we highlight the common mistakes that beginners and first-time researchers make in understanding and implementing the theory of particle filtering. We also discuss and demonstrate the use of particle filtering in nonlinear state estimation applications. We conclude the primer by providing an implementable version of MATLAB code for particle filters. The code not only aids in improving the understanding of particle filters, it also serves as a template for building and implementing advanced nonlinear state estimation routines.</p>

Their optimal design and management are important for safe and profitable operations. The use of accurate mathematical models can help in achieving the best performance. This article provides a detailed description of a finite volume method (FVM) for a pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) Li-ion battery model suitable for the development of model-based advanced battery management systems.

    <p>The collection of sawmill residuals is an important logistic activity for the pulp and paper industry, which use the biomass as a source of energy. We study a vehicle routing problem for a network composed of a single depot and 25 nearby sawmills in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia, Canada. The sawmills serve as potential suppliers of residual biomass to the depot, which in turn processes and distributes the sawmill residuals to the pulp and paper mills. This problem consists of identifying the best daily routing schedule for a fixed number of vehicles. The objective is to maximize the ratio of residual dry tonnes collected to kilometers traveled, while achieving a minimum daily amount of residual dry mass. There are several random components in the problem, including the availability and moisture content of the residuals as well as the time spent on the road to retrieve the residuals. We use a combination of scenario analysis and heuristics to solve this stochastic vehicle routing problem (SPVRP).</p>

    <p>In modern chemical processes, identification of the process variable connectivity and their topology is vital for maintaining the operational safety. As a general information theoretic method, transfer entropy can analyze the causality between two variables based on estimation of conditional probability density functions. Transfer entropy estimation is typically a data driven method, however, the associated high computational complexity and poor accuracy are not acceptable in real applications. Using a nonlinear stochastic state-space model in conjunction with particle filters, a novel transfer entropy estimation method is proposed. The proposed approach requires less data, is fast and accurate.</p>

    <p>\textcopyright 2016, Taiwanese Society of Biomedical Engineering.Several methods have been proposed for evaluating a person’s insulin sensitivity from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the euglycemic insulin clamp technique. However, none are easy or inexpensive to implement since the plasma insulin concentration, a key variable for assessing the insulin sensitivity index (ISI), is required to be clinically measured at specific times. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a new ISI that can be easily and accurately obtained by patients themselves without costly, time-consuming, and inconvenient testing methods. This study proposes a simple self-administered testing method, simulated on a computerized model of type II diabetic patients, for estimating the ISI. The test involves a 75-g glucose ingestion and two injections of 10 mU/kg insulin. Blood glucose is measured 1 and 2 h later. The test was evaluated by using a previously developed diabetic-patient dynamic model. Fifteen sets of OGTT data from diabetic patients published in the literature were used for the model development. A simulation of the proposed self-administered test indicates that the proposed ISI correlates well with the ISI called M-value obtained from the gold standard but elaborate euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (r = 0.927, p = 0.0045). The proposed ISI is considered to be easy to perform, time-saving, inexpensive, and accurate enough for clinical assessments.</p>

    <p>With decades of successful application of model predictive control (MPC) to industrial processes, practitioners are now focused on ease of commissioning, monitoring, and automation of maintenance. Many industries do not necessarily need better algorithms, but rather improved usability of existing technologies to allow a limited workforce of varying expertise to easily commission, use, and maintain these valued applications. Continuous performance monitoring, and automated model reidentification are being used as vendors work to deliver automated adaptive MPC.

    <p>Diabetes mellitus is one of the leading diseases in the developed world. In order to better regulate blood glucose in a diabetic patient, improved modelling of insulin-glucose dynamics is a key factor in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. In the current work, the insulin-glucose dynamics in type II diabetes mellitus can be modelled by using a stochastic nonlinear state-space model. Estimating the parameters of such a model is difficult as only a few blood glucose and insulin measurements per day are available in a non-clinical setting. Therefore, developing a predictive model of the blood glucose of a person with type II diabetes mellitus is important when the glucose and insulin concentrations are only available at irregular intervals. To overcome these difficulties, we resort to online sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) estimation of states and parameters of the state-space model for type II diabetic patients under various levels of randomly missing clinical data. Our results show that this method is efficient in monitoring and estimating the dynamics of the peripheral glucose, insulin and incretins concentration when 10, 25 and 50 % of the simulated clinical data were randomly removed.</p>

    <p>This study proposes a strategy for detecting possible dysfunction of organs such as the liver, pancreas, muscles and adipose tissues in a group of type II diabetic patients. Several in silico clinical trials are performed on a previously developed type II diabetes model. Since the pancreatic insulin secretion rate and glucose metabolic rates of different organs represent the functional behavior of the corresponding organs, calculated values of these rates are analyzed and compared with the corresponding rates calculated from a healthy subject’s model to detect possible abnormalities. These rates are calculated from estimated values of glucose and insulin concentrations inside the corresponding organs/tissues from the physiological model. Estimation of the concentrations in body organs/tissues is carried out using a sequential Monte Carlo filtering method called particle filters. The results show that the proposed strategy is capable of detecting deficiencies in hepatic and peripheral glucose disposal, hepatic glucose production and pancreatic insulin secretion. The information provided by this strategy can potentially be used to tailor patient dietary requirements and/or select appropriate medications for the patients.

    <p>\textcopyright 2015 American Automatic Control Council.Since the minimum variance controller (MVC) provides the smallest achievable output variance, performance indices based on minimum variance benchmarking have been applied extensively to both univariate and multivariate systems. This paper extends the idea of minimum variance benchmarking to the performance monitoring of cross-directional (CD) processes in paper machines. A performance index is proposed based on the spatial and temporal minimum variance benchmark for the CD process. Computational complexity of the high dimensional time series estimation is reduced by taking advantage of the special structure in the coefficient matrices. Illustrative examples from a paper machine simulator and industrial data sets are provided to show the effectiveness of the techniques as well as the insensitivity of the performance index to high frequency spatial disturbances.</p>

    <p>\textcopyright 2015 IEEE.Structural wear on impeller blades of industrial centrifugal pumps leads to reduced pump efficiency and occasional plant downtime. An online sensor that can measure the pump wear allows for maintaining the efficiency through a predictive maintenance schedule. A magnetic sensor is designed to measure the structural wear on impeller blades. This sensor can be installed on existing pumps and does not require any pump modifications. Using a magnetic circuit with the pump and its components, wear is estimated by measuring the gap between the impeller and the pump housing. As the impeller wears, the gap between the impeller and the pump housing increases causing the reluctance of the magnetic circuit to increase which in turn reduces the inductance of the coil driving the magnetic circuit. This online magnetic sensor includes an electronic circuit and has an unamplified sensitivity of 0.60 V/mm.</p>

    <p>Non-linear state filters of different approximations and capabilities allow for real-time estimation of unmeasured states in non-linear stochastic processes. It is well known that the performance of non-linear filters depends on the underlying numerical and statistical approximations used in their design. Despite the theoretical and practical interest in evaluating the performance of non-linear filtering methods, it remains one of the most complex problems in the area of state estimation. We propose the use of posterior Cram?r-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) or mean square error (MSE) inequality as a filtering performance benchmark. Using the PCRLB inequality, we develop assessment and diagnosis tools for monitoring and evaluating the performance of non-linear filters. Using the PCRLB inequality-based performance assessment tool, an optimal non-linear filter switching strategy is proposed for state estimation in general non-linear systems. The non-linear filter switching strategy is an optimal performance strategy, which maintains high filtering performance under all operating conditions. The complex, high dimensional integrals involved in the computation of the PCRLB inequality-based non-linear filter assessment and diagnosis tools are approximated using sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) methods. The utility and efficacy of the developed tools are illustrated through a numerical example. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.</p>

    <p>Modulating autophagy provides a new method to increase CHO cell protein production. A fed-batch protocol using the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyl adenine (3-MA), developed for a tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) expressing DHFR based CHO cell line, was successfully adapted to a monoclonal antibody (MAb) expressing CHOK1-SV based CHO cell line. By optimizing the timing and dose of 3-MA treatment, the cell-specific productivity was increased 4-fold, resulting in 2-fold increased total MAb production. The positive effect of the 3-MA treatment appeared to be reduced when the amino acid feed concentration was increased 5-fold. Further investigation revealed that by slowly increasing osmolality up to ~450. mOsm/kg, both the cell-specific productivity and the total MAb almost doubled. This effect was replicated with a DUXB-based CHO cell line expressing a human-llama chimeric antibody. The positive effect of gradually increasing osmolality was then combined with the positive effects of the 3-MA treatment, however their combined effect were not additive. Thus, either increased osmolality or 3-MA treatment were equally effective in increasing MAb-CHO cell fed-batch production on the cell lines tested. Analysis of protein glycosylation showed that both of these fed-batch modifications did not substantially influence the overall glycan profiles of the MAb product. \textcopyright 2014.</p>

    <p>This paper considers the identification of kinetic parameters associated with the dynamics of closed biochemical reaction networks. These reaction networks are modeled by chemical master equations in which the reactions and the associated concentrations/populations of species are characterized by probability distributions. The vector of unknown kinetic parameters is usually highly sparse. Using this sparsity, a robust statistical estimation algorithm is developed to estimate the kinetic parameters from stochastic experimental data. The algorithm is based on regularized maximum likelihood estimation and it is shown to be decomposable into a two-stage optimization. The first-stage optimization has a closed-form solution and the second-stage optimization is to maximize sparsity in the kinetic parameter vector with a guaranteed data-fitting error. The second-stage optimization can be solved using off-the-shelf algorithms for constrained ℓ1 minimization.</p>

    <p>The chemical and mineral processing industries need a nonlinear process monitoring method to improve the stability and economy of their processes. Techniques that are currently available to these industries are often too computationally intensive for an industrial control system, or they are too complex to commission. In this paper, we propose using supervised locally linear embedding for projection (SLLEP) as a new nonlinear process monitoring technique to solve these issues. In addition, we suggest using a commonly available tool in modern industrial control systems, a model predictive control, to solve the quadratic program of SLLEP in real-time and with minimal effort to commission. As a case study, we demonstrate that process monitoring with SLLEP can detect and diagnose the early onset of a semiautogenous grinding (SAG) mill overload. A SAG mill overload is a highly nonlinear operating situation, and we show that principal component analysis, the best-in-class technique currently used by the industry for monitoring an overload, is unable to detect the early onset of an overload. \textcopyright 2013 American Chemical Society.</p>

    <p>This paper presents a new method for controlling the height of a mineral processing dry-surge ore pile between specified upper and lower levels by manipulating the outlet ore flow. The upper level should not be exceeded for safety, while the height should always be higher than the lowest allowable level to maintain a reserve for continuous operation downstream of the ore pile. However, this is a non-trivial control problem because the disturbance of the unpredictable discontinuous ore input must be attenuated in the continuous outlet ore flow. In addition, ore is mined from multiple sites and causes the physical properties of the ore to be uncertain. To deal with these issues, a control problem is formulated to attenuate the disturbance from the discontinuous feed and guarantee stability given the inaccurate process model. To solve the formulated control problem, a robust H∞ height controller is developed using the linear matrix inequality technique. It is shown that the robust H∞ controller attenuates four times more variability in outlet ore flow than a gain-scheduled PI controller and guarantees robust closed loop stability. \textcopyright 2013 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering.</p>

    <p>On-line estimation plays an important role in process control and monitoring. Obtaining a theoretical solution to the simultaneous state-parameter estimation problem for non-linear stochastic systems involves solving complex multi-dimensional integrals that are not amenable to analytical solution. While basic sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) or particle filtering (PF) algorithms for simultaneous estimation exist, it is well recognized that there is a need for making these on-line algorithms non-degenerate, fast and applicable to processes with missing measurements. To overcome the deficiencies in traditional algorithms, this work proposes a Bayesian approach to on-line state and parameter estimation. Its extension to handle missing data in real-time is also provided. The simultaneous estimation is performed by filtering an extended vector of states and parameters using an adaptive sequential-importance- resampling (SIR) filter with a kernel density estimation method. The approach uses an on-line optimization algorithm based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to allow adaptation of the SIR filter for combined state-parameter estimation. An optimal tuning rule to control the width of the kernel and the variance of the artificial noise added to the parameters is also proposed. The approach is illustrated through numerical examples.?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>

    <p>The posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) derived in [1] provides a bound on the mean square error (MSE) obtained with any nonlinear state filter. Computing the PCRLB involves solving complex, multi-dimensional expectations, which do not lend themselves to an easy analytical solution. Furthermore, any attempt to approximate it using numerical or simulation-based approaches require a priori access to the true states, which may not be available, except in simulations or in carefully designed experiments. To allow recursive approximation of the PCRLB when the states are hidden or unmeasured, a new approach based on sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) or particle filters (PFs) is proposed. The approach uses SMC methods to estimate the hidden states using a sequence of the available sensor measurements. The developed method is general and can be used to approximate the PCRLB in nonlinear systems with non-Gaussian state and sensor noise. The efficacy of the developed method is illustrated on two simulation examples, including a practical problem of ballistic target tracking at reentry phase.</p>

    <p>The occurrence of model-plant mismatch is a common problem in dynamic model based applications such as state estimation. The use of an inaccurate model results in biased estimates of the states. Hence, conventional state estimation algorithms are modified in various ways to compensate for model-plant mismatch. In this work, the performance of four adaptive state estimation algorithms is compared in the presence of a model plant mismatch arising due to random drifts in parameter values. The comparison is carried out through simulations on a benchmark non-isothermal CSTR problem. Simulation results demonstrate that online reidentification of the parameters susceptible to drift or change is the most effective approach to minimize the effect of model-plant mismatch on the state estimates. \textcopyright IFAC.</p>

    <p>The moving horizon estimator (MHE) formulation utilizes a window of measurements to compute the estimates of the states in that particular window. This approach leads to smoothing of the state estimates included in the window, since future information is used to compute the same. However, the effect of smoothing, in the MHE algorithm, on the state estimates has not been studied in the literature. In this work the performance of the MHE is compared with recursive Bayesian state estimators (such as UKF, EnKF) to study the effect of the moving window of the past data on the quality of state estimates, via an application on a benchmark pH simulation case study. The simulations are carried out for two scenarios-the ideal case and the case with a parametric model-plant mismatch. The results obtained indicate that the use of MHE results in improved state estimates when compared to the recursive Bayesian state estimators, but does not help compensate for model-plant-mismatch. \textcopyright IFAC.</p>

Its extension to handle missing data in real-time is also provided. The simultaneous estimation is performed by filtering an extended vector of states and parameters using an adaptive sequential-importance- resampling (SIR) filter with a kernel density estimation method. The approach uses an on-line optimization algorithm based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to allow adaptation of the SIR filter for combined state-parameter estimation. An optimal tuning rule to control the width of the kernel and the variance of the artificial noise added to the parameters is also proposed. The approach is illustrated through numerical examples.\textcopyright 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>

    <p>The dynamics of Li-ion batteries are often defined by a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations called the pseudo two-dimensional model. It is widely accepted that this model, while accurate, is too complex for estimation and control. As such, the literature is replete with numerous approximations of this model. For the first time, an algorithm for state- of-charge estimation using the original pseudo two-dimensional model is provided. A discrete version of the model is reformulated into a state-space model by separating linear, nonlinear, and algebraic states. This model is high dimensional (of the order of tens to hundreds of states) and consists of implicit nonlinear algebraic equations. The degeneracy problems with high-dimensional state estimation are circumvented by developing a particle filter algorithm that sweeps in time and spatial coordinates independently. The implicit algebraic equations are handled by ensuring the presence of a ‘tether’ particle in the algorithm. The approach is illustrated through simulations. Keywords:</p>

    <p>Molecular dynamics(MD)simulations results are herein incorporated into anelectrostaticmodel used to determine the structure of an effective polymer-based antidote to the anticoagulant fondaparinux. In silico data for the polymer or its cationic binding groups has not, up to now, been available, and experimental data on the structure of the polymer-fondaparinux complex is extremely limited. Consequently, the task of optimizing the polymer structure is a daunting challenge. MD simulations provided a means to gain microscopic information on the interactions of the binding groups and fondaparinux that would have otherwise been inaccessible. Tis was used to refine the electrostatic model and improve the quantitative model predictions of binding affinity. Once refined, the model provided guidelines to improve electrostatic forces between candidate polymers and fondaparinux in order to increase association rate constants. 1.</p>

    <p>In the last two decades, several methods based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) have been proposed for Bayesian identification of stochastic non-linear state-space models (SSMs). It is well known that the performance of these simulation based identification methods depends on the numerical approximations used in their design. We propose the use of posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) as a mean square error (MSE) bound. Using PCRLB, a systematic procedure is developed to analyse the estimates delivered by Bayesian identification methods in terms of bias, MSE, and efficiency.

    <p>First-principles models that incorporate all of the key physics that affect the internal states of a lithium-ion battery are in the form of coupled nonlinear PDEs. While these models are very accurate in terms of prediction capability, the models cannot be employed for on-line control and monitoring purposes due to the huge computational cost. A reformulated model [1] is capable of predicting the internal states of battery with a full simulation running in milliseconds without compromising on accuracy. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of using this reformulated model for control-relevant real-time applications. The reformulated model is used to compute optimal protocols for battery operations to demonstrate that the computational cost of each optimal control calculation is low enough to be completed within the sampling interval in model predictive control (MPC). Observability studies are then presented to confirm that this model can be used for state-estimation-based MPC. A moving horizon estimator (MHE) technique was implemented due to its ability to explicitly address constraints and nonlinear dynamics. The MHE uses the reformulated model to be computationally feasible in real time. The feature of reformulated model to be solved in real time opens up the possibility of incorporating detailed physics-based model in battery management systems (BMS) to design and implement better monitoring and control strategies.</p>

    <p>Online estimation of the internal states is a perquisite for monitoring, control, and fault diagnosis of many engineering processes. A cost effective approach to monitor these variables in real time is to employ model-based state estimation techniques. Dynamic model-based state estimation is a rich and highly active area of research and many novel approaches have emerged over the last few years. In this paper, we review various recent developments in the area of nonlinear state estimators from a Bayesian perspective. In particular, we focus on the constrained state estimation (including systems modeled using differential-algebraic equations), the handling of multi-rate and delayed measurements and recent advances in model parameter estimation. Recent advances on the stability analysis of the estimation error dynamics are also briefly discussed. The review aims to provide an integrated view of important ideas, from the authors’ perspective that have driven the research in this area in recent years. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.</p>

    <p>Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent commonly used for the treatment of Type II diabetes mellitus. However, its effects on patients are derived usually from clinical experiments. In this study, a dynamic model of Type II diabetes mellitus with the treatment of metformin is proposed. The Type II diabetic model is a modification of an existing compartmental diabetic model. The dynamic simulation of the metformin effect for a Type II diabetic patient is based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship with a human body. The corresponding model parameters are estimated by optimization using clinical data from published reports. Then, the effect of metformin in both intravenous and oral administration on a Type II diabetes mellitus model are compared. The combination treatment of insulin infusion plus oral metformin is shown to be superior than the monotherapy with oral metformin only. These results are consistent with the clinical understanding of the use of metformin. For further work, the model can be analyzed for evaluating the treatment of diabetes mellitus with different pharmacological agents.</p>

    <p>The use of unfractionated heparin (UFH) and heparin derivatives as anticoagulants is an essential clinical practice in modern medicine. An overdose of these medications can lead to life-threatening bleeding episodes, and therefore antidotes are required. Fondaparinux is a new heparin derivative that has become increasingly important in clinical medicine due to its advantages over current anticoagulants. However, there is no antidote currently available for fondaparinux, and its utilization in clinics can be significantly increased by developing an effective antidote. In this article, we report the development of a mathematical model to aid the design of a polymer-based antidote for fondaparinux. A model was developed to characterize the binding between the polymer and fondaparinux. This model allows for the rapid testing of multiple polymer candidate structures in silico and thus reduces both the cost and time associated with the trial and error approach to polymer development. The model calculates the association rate constant (k(a)) from a modified Debye-Huckel equation for electrostatic interactions between charged molecules and uses this as a metric for binding affinity. The polymer is modeled as a sphere with cationic binding units randomly placed on its surface. Its size and the number and flexibility of binding units were studied through computer simulations. This model indicated that the binding units were flexible in nature and were spaced at least 9.85 x 10(-10) m apart on the polymer surface. Furthermore, it was found that smaller polymers exhibit higher k(a) values and a greater binding unit efficiency, indicating that reducing the size of the polymer molecules would enhance binding. Given the very limited information available on the interactions between the polymer and fondaparinux, this mathematical model is a powerful tool to provide qualitative information on these interactions and their electrostatic rate enhancement.</p>

    <p>The hydrodynamics of fluidized beds strongly influence their operation, but are complicated and chaotic. There are many measurement techniques, but none fully characterizes gas-solid fluidized beds. Acoustic signals from fluidized beds cover a wide frequency spectrum and can be correlated to bed characteristics. Experiments were conducted to study the acoustic signals from ultrasonic transducers mounted on the outer wall of a two-dimensional fluidization column. The acoustic signals were related to bubble behavior in 550??m glass beads. Simultaneous acoustic and pressure measurements allowed direct comparison of these signals for single bubbles, pairs and chains of bubbles. The envelope of acoustic signals, generated by particle collisions and particle-wall impacts, provided information on the behavior of bubbles. Significant peaks appeared as the top portions of the bubble wakes approached the acoustic sensor. Pressure waves propagated considerably in the horizontal direction, whereas acoustic signals propagated little in the lateral direction, but transmitted forward in the wall in the direction of bubble motion, maintaining the wave profile invariant during transmission. The strong lateral localization of acoustic signals is promising for determining the lateral bubble position in the bed. Acoustic signals provide a potential means of determining such bubble properties as velocity, frequency and volume, with some advantages relative to pressure signals. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.</p>

    <p>Type II diabetes mellitus is characterized by both insulin resistance and &x03B2;-cell failure. Although patients with type II diabetes mellitus are not initially dependent on insulin, the introduction of insulin therapy becomes one of the most effective methods of attaining good glycemic control. In this work, a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is implemented to maintain normoglycemia in a simulated Type II diabetic patient using a closed-loop insulin infusion pump. The simulation employs a compartment model, which represents the glucose regulatory system and includes submodels representing the absorption of subcutaneously administered short-acting insulin and gut absorption. The feedback control system returns blood glucose to normoglycemic ranges after a meal disturbance. The settling time is similar to that of a non-diabetic. These results demonstrate the potential use of control algorithms for regulation of blood glucose by insulin for Type II diabetic patients.</p>

    <p>The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is established by history, physical examination, and measurements of serum or plasma glucose concentrations under specific conditions. This disorder represents the final common expression of diverse etiologies which are incompletely understood. The treatable causes of diabetes should be identified, and the appropriate therapy initiated. Distinguishing Type I and Type II diabetes is often useful, but not a necessary prerequisite for initiating therapy. As we begin to understand the underlying causes of diabetes, our emphasis is likely to shift from a diagnosis based on metabolic characteristics to a diagnosis based on etiology.</p>

    <p>A novel maximum likelihood solution to the problem of identifying parameters of a nonlinear model under missing observations is presented. An expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, which uses the expected value of the complete log-likelihood function including the missing observations, is developed. The expected value of the complete log-likelihood (E-step) in the EM algorithm is approximated using particle filters and smoothers. New expressions for particle filters and smoothers under missing observations are derived. The maximization step (M-step) in the EM algorithm is performed using standard optimization routines. The above nonlinear identification approach is illustrated through numerical examples. Copyright \textcopyright 2007 International Federation of Automatic Control All Rights Reserved.</p>

    <p>Good cross-directional control of sheet variables in a paper machine depends on a number of factors. One such factor is the correct alignment of actuators with their corresponding responses. The alignment changes with time either locally or across the whole paper sheet due to a variety of reasons. In this paper, we provide an online mapping technique based on estimating the cross-correlation between actuator movement and the measurements. This procedure involves two steps-in the first step (called alignment monitoring) we determine if the current mapping is wrong at any CD position, and in the second step (called re-mapping), the alignment of actuators is corrected. The main advantage of this method is in its ability to re-align under closed loop conditions with minimal operational disruption. ?? 2008 ISA.</p>

    <p>In many chemical processes, variables which indicate product quality are infrequently and irregularly sampled. Often, the inter-sample behavior of these quality variables can be inferred from manipulated variables and other process variables which are measured frequently. When the quality variables are irregularly sampled, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the model parameters can be performed using the expectation maximization (EM) approach. A state-space model identification procedure based on the EM algorithm yields a Kalman filter-based prediction-correction mechanism which can be used for optimal prediction of the quality variables. In this paper, we describe such a state-space model identification and estimation method and present the results of its application on simulation, laboratory-scale and industrial case studies. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Process symmetry is essential to our methods. We show that every symmetric noncausal process admits a spectrally equivalent causal model, then prove that the maximum likelihood estimate of this causal model converges to that of the original noncausal process.

    <p>The development and application of gray-box identification techniques for modelling the bleaching operation in a Bleached Chemi-Thermo Mechanical Pulp (BCTMP) mill are explained. The process is characterized as a delay dominant recycle process with significant input nonlinearities. The identification was carried out using routine operating data in which the outputs were measured irregularly. The effects of these characteristics and consequent modifications of the system identification techniques are discussed. The resulting models are being used for online prediction and model-based controller design at the mill with satisfactory performance. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>

    <p>In this paper a model predictive control relevant identification (MRI) method is applied to a general class of linear PEM models and the effect of bias distribution on the multistep ahead predictions is studied. Good multistep ahead predictions are essential for model predictive controllers. Therefore, it is important to distribute the bias in such a way that it is compatible with the predictive control objective. This paper deals with the impact of MRI methods on the bias distribution and its effect on control loop performance. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>
